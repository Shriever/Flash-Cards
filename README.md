A Flash Card Project made with OOP in JS.

This project is a variation of Traversy Media's Booklist project - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaMCxVWtW58

It allows for quite a bit of interactivity from the user creating simple flash cards. 

After creating this project I feel more comfortable with OOP and interacting with localStorage.
