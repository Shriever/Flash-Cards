# Flash-Cards
A Flash Card Project made with OOP in JS.

This Project is a variation of Traversy Media's Booklist project.

This project allows for quite a bit of interactivity from the user
while creating simple flash cards. 

After creating this project I feel quite comfortable with my OOP skils
as well as my ability to interact with localStorage.
